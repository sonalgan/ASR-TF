# Automatic Speaker Recognition using Transfer Learning Approach of DL Models

This project is based on a dataset based on Librivox audiobooks which trains two deep learning models : CNN and ANN ; and compares their results after testing it on data collected either from Youtube or collected live.

# Testing Demo
To test the pretrained models, run Transfer_Learning.ipynb.
## CNN
Run the model on pretrained weights model.h5 and test data containiing in folder tfdata1 in png format.
## ANN
Run the model on pretrained weights ann_weights80.h5 and test data containiing in folder ann_data as spectrograms of csv format.
